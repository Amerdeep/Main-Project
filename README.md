Job Posting Classifier: Real/Fake.

Abstract


In recent years, due to advancement in modern technology and social communication, advertising new job posts has become a very common issue in the present world. There are a lot of job advertisements on the internet, even on the reputed job advertising sites, which never seem fake. But after the selection, the so-called recruiters start asking for the money and the bank details. Many of the candidates fall in their trap and lose a lot of money and the current job sometimes. Identifying it manually is very difficult and almost impossible. 
The project proposes an automated solution based on machine learning-based classification approaches to prevent fraudulent job postings on the internet. We can determine which job postings are fraudulent and which are not by conducting an exploratory data analysis on the data and using the insights gained. We will be using different classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier,Na√Øve Bayes classifier etc.And comparing their accuracy and precision score to get the most suitable model. Also we are planning to make our work user friendly through website hosting.
